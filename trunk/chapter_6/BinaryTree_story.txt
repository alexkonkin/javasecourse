Given: root node of the binary tree
When : I create the root node
Then : the root node with the one data field and 
		the two fields that initialized with null 
		should be created
	   
Given: one item should be added to the binary tree
When  : If it does not have any child nodes 
Then : the item should be added as the right leaf if the
       value in the leaf is bigger then the value in the
	   parent node
And  : If the value is the less then the value in the parent leaf
Then : the item should be added as the left leaf.
		
Given: height of the binary tree should be calculated
When : I check the binary three height
Then : the integer value that represents the height of the tree
		should be returned
		
Given: contents of the binary tree should be printed
When : I request the contents of the binary tree
Then : contents of the binary tree should be printed

Given: the binary tree has root node with the value 10 and 2 child nodes
       with the values 9 and 11
When : I add to the binary tree the value with the number 8
	   it should be added as a child to the node with the value equal to 9
	   as a left leaf
